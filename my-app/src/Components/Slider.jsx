For example, a 2 and an 8 add to 10, and so can be eliminated if they are adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically. Similar for 1 â€“ 9, 3 â€“ 7, etc., as well as 4 â€“ 4, 5 â€“ 5, etc. There can be black space between the numbers; the rule is that there cannot be another number between them.'
